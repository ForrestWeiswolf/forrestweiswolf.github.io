    <p>I've worked as a software engineer for some time, most recently on the data enrichment team at Mintel, working
      primarily on improving their data pipelines;
      prior to that, I worked for Accenture<sup><a href="#footnote-1" class="footnote">*</a></sup>,

      <small id="footnote-1"><sup>*</sup> Actually, I applied to a job at a small software consultancy called Pillar
        Technology, which was acquired by Accenture shortly before I joined, so I was working with Pillar teams in the
        Pillar style the whole time.</small>
